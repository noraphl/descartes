	<h1 id="phrase"> Cogito, ergo sum </h1>
	<h1 id="subtitle"> ... and the begining of modern philosophy </h1>
	<p>Descartes ahead his contemporary fellows, who still backed up their arguments with appeals to God, and trusted in nothing more than rational thinking. His works in logic, mathematics, geometry and optics influenced deeply his philosophical studies. </p>
	<p>In his book <em>Rules for the direction of the mind</em>, he points out that through bringing to light the true riches of our souls, we can find all the knowledge we can need to the conduct of life without the help from anyone else. </p>
	<p>He trusted in introspection, and believed that everything that is wrong with the world is caused by misusage of our minds: confussion and unconscious illogicality. Thus, sound arguments and clarity of mind was what he aimed to achieve with his work.</p>
	<h3 class="doubts">Method of doubts</h3>
	<p class="p_doubts">Descartes proposed that the way to solve large or difficult problems, <br>is to divide the problem into small and understandable questions. <br>He compares his method to the task of inspecting a big barrel of <br>apples, where all apples should be sorted out in order to separate <br>the good apples from the bad ones. </p>
	<p>Descartes stated that all ideas should be grounded in individual experience and reason, instead of being guided by tradition or authority. In his book <em>Discurse on the method</em>, he describes how he resolved it: by abandoning all studies and seek no knowledge than what comes from within or else in the great book of the world. He spent most of his life traveling and getting involved with a great variety of people, gaining experience and deriving profit from what it came in his way.</p>
	<p>His famous phrase <span class="i_think">"I think, therefore I am"</span> appeared first in <em>Discurse on the method</em> and some years later in <em>Principles of philosophy</em>. It is the ultimate answer to the most intriguing question that interests philosophers: how can one be sure that anything, inluding oneself, atually exists?. He first realized that our senses are unreliable, so all we know from the exterior world could easily be only ones imagination or dreams; from this conception derives that there is one thing he could know for sure: he was thinking. In this way, he could not be thinking if he did not exist, or in other words: <span class="i_think">"I think, therefore I am"</span></p>
	<p>From this principle he aimes to search more irrefutable truths. He stated that one can solve the most profund problems by searching deep within oneself, and without the need of teams or equipment. He prefered the beauty of pure quiet reflection of thinking over other practical tasks.</p>
	<p>In his last work, <em>The passions of the soul</em>, he advocates to the description of passions as if no one has ever dedicated to it, and he identified six fundamental passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness, and the many combinations that may result. He finishes this book with a guide to control our passions and enjoy a virtuous life, <em>The discipline of virtue</em>. </p>
	<p>In 1649, he moves to Sweden for the task of teaching philosophy to Queen Christina. Due to difficulties in the Queen's schedule, classes were held 5:00am. Descartes, who always hated cold, fell ill rapidly and died of pneumonia three months after his arrival, at a age of 53.</p>
	<p class="end">His philosophical work should be understood beyond the famous phrase, but as a way to achieve by ourselves a rationally founded vision, independent from all other sources arround us.</p>
